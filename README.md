## Inshore Vessel Detection Using Sentinel-1 SAR Image

### Abstract

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have advantage of being able to observe Earth surface all-weather and all-day. However, when applying ship detection techniques which is previously presented methods to inshore area, there is a limitation of having a low ship detection rate and a high false alarm rate due to artificial structures. In this study, research was conducted to improve ship detection performance using the statistical and deep learning methods presented in previous studies. In the statistical method, a Frozen Background Reference (FBR) image was generated using amplitude variance, and Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm was applied to the ratio image generated as an FBR image. CFAR-guided Convolutional Neural Network (CG-CNN) was performed to apply deeplearning method to detect ships in inshore area. When applying the commonly used CFAR, miss detection of ships near the port and false alarms caused by artificial structures were occurred. There was miss detection of docked ships and large amount of false alarms caused by dock in case of CG-CNN. In order to compensate for these, we combined statistical method and CG-CNN. Then miss detected ships were detected. In particular, ship detection performance improved by about 9.1% compared to CG-CNN, and false alarms decreased by about 56% compared to statistical methods.
